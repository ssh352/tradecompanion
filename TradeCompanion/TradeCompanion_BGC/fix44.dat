5=AdvTransType,String,Identifies advertisement message transaction type.\nValid values:  	\n  N = New\n  C = Cancel\n  R = Replace
6=AvgPx,Price,Calculated average price of all fills on this order.
7=BeginSeqNo,int,Message sequence number of first message in range to be resent
8=BeginString,String,Identifies beginning of new message and protocol version.  ALWAYS FIRST FIELD IN MESSAGE. (Always unencrypted)	\nValid values:\nFIX.4.2
9=BodyLength,int,Message length, in bytes, forward to the CheckSum field.  ALWAYS SECOND FIELD IN MESSAGE. (Always unencrypted)
10=CheckSum,String,Three byte, simple checksum  (see Appendix B: CheckSum Calculation for description).  ALWAYS LAST FIELD IN MESSAGE; i.e. serves, with the trailing <SOH>, as the end-of-message delimiter.  Always defined as three characters. (Always unencrypted)
11=ClOrdID,String,Unique identifier for Order as assigned by institution (identified by SenderCompID or OnBehalfOfCompID as appropriate).  Uniqueness must be guaranteed within a single trading day.  Firms, particularly those  which electronically submit multi-day orders, trade globally or throughout market close periods,should ensure  uniqueness across days, for example by embedding a date within the ClOrdID field.
12=Commission,Amt,Commission.  Note if CommType is percentage, Commission of 5% should be represented as .05.
13=CommType,char,Commission type	\nValid values:\n  1 = per share\n  2 = percentage\n  3 = absolute

16=EndSeqNo,int,Message sequence number of last message in range to be resent.  If request is for a single message BeginSeqNo = EndSeqNo.  If request is for all messages subsequent to a particular message, EndSeqNo = "0" (representing infinity).
17=ExecID,String,Unique identifier of execution message as assigned by broker (will be 0 (zero) for ExecTransType=3 (Status)).  	Uniqueness must be guaranteed within a single trading day or the life of a multi-day order.  Firms which accept multi-day orders should consider embedding a date within the ExecID field to assure uniqueness across days.	(Prior to FIX 4.1 this field was of type int)
18=ExecInst,MultipleValueString,Instructions for order handling on exchange trading floor.  If more than one instruction is applicable to an order, this field can contain multiple instructions separated by space.\nValid values:\n  1 = Not held\n  2 = Work\n  3 = Go along\n  4 = Over the day\n  5 = Held	\n  6 = Participate don't initiate\n  7 = Strict scale\n  8 = Try to scale\n  9 = Stay on bidside\n  0 = Stay on offerside\n  A = No cross (cross is forbidden)\n  B = OK to cross\n  C = Call first\n  D = Percent of volume "(indicates that the sender does not want to be all of the volume on the floor vs. a specific percentage)"\n  E = Do not increase - DNI\n  F = Do not reduce - DNR\n  G = All or none - AON\n  I = Institutions only\n  L = Last peg (last sale)\n  M = Mid-price peg (midprice of inside quote)\n  N = Non-negotiable\n  O = Opening peg\n  P = Market peg\n  R = Primary peg (primary market - buy at bid/sell at offer)\n  S = Suspend\n  T = Fixed Peg to Local best bid or offer at time of order\n  U = Customer Display Instruction (Rule11Ac1-1/4)\n  V = Netting (for Forex)\n  W = Peg to VWAP
