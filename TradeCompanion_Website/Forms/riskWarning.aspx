                    Before deciding to participate in the Forex market,
                    you should carefully consider your investment 
                    objectives, level of experience and risk appetite.
                    Most importantly, do not invest money you cannot 
                    afford to lose

                   There is considerable exposure to risk in any off-exchange foreign exchange transaction, 
                   including, but not limited to, leverage, creditworthiness, limited regulatory protection 
                   and market volatility that may substantially affect the price, or liquidity of a currency

                   More over, the leveraged nature of forex trading means that any market movement will have 
                   an equally proportional effect on your deposited funds. This may work against you as well as 
                   for you. The possibility exists that you could sustain a total loss of initial margin funds 
                  and be required to deposit additional funds to maintain your position. If you fail to meet any 
                  margin requirement, your position may be liquidated and you will be responsible for any resulting 
                  losses. To manage exposure, employ risk-reducing strategies such as 'stop-loss' or 'limit' orders.
