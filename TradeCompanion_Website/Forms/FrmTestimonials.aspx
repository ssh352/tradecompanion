    "I am excited about the impact that Trade The News has had on my company's daily 
    trading plans for my traders. Besides providing key economic news information within
     seconds of the release, I have noticed their commitment to continually provide
      additional services that have proven to add to my company's trading profitability.
        The service also provides key intraday support and resistance levels that draw 
        price action so profit-taking levels or new entries for positions can be established 
        within the confines of a well-researched trading framework. They have become much 
        more than a news service but have transformed into a necessary resource for providing 
        a solid "edge" for active spot  trading."

     has been more than generous in their support of our operations in 
     terms of training and development of our staff, management and board. 
     Whatever we have needed we have received irrespective of the contracted 
     commitments. This support is further strengthened by the great systems
      in place such as Webtrader, Members Portal, and all other behind the 
      scenes operations.’
            <br />
